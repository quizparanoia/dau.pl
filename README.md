# dau.pl - write like an idiot

`dau.pl` is a Perl script for the IRC client [irssi](http://irssi.org/).

dau? What does that mean? It's a german acronym for _d√ºmmster anzunehmender user_. In english: _stupidest imaginable user_.

With `dau.pl` every person can write like an idiot on the IRC!

Actually you can write like an idiot everywhere by using the dauomat.

Websites can be "translated" by using the dauproxy.

`dau.pl` is written by [Clemens Heidinger <heidinger@dau.pl>](mailto:heidinger@daul.pl) and licensed under the BSD license.
